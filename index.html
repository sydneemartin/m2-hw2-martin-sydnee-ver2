    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Sydnee Martin and I currently reside in Winchester, VA with my family and my three-year-old pup named
        Harlow. I have a B.A. in American Studies from The George Washington University and I am currently in my final
        semester of graduate school at the University of Florida. In May 2025, I am set to receive my M.A. in
        Communications, Global Strategic Communications</p>

    <h2> Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Traveled to over 20 countries.</li>
        <li>Self-published a book at 15.</li>
        <li> My dad is from Jamaica and we visit very frequently</li>
        <li> I am a first-time dog owner.</li>
        <li>I have a photography business on the side</li>
        <li>I am soon to be a first-time homeowner!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>

    <p>After graduate school, I would like to utilize my degree and have my career focus on communications. Although
        that is pretty vague at the moment. I'm hoping that I can use my graduate school experience in a field focused
        on urban and community forestry or program management for community engagement.</p>
